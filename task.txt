### 📋 Copy & Paste to Claude Code (Production Launch)

**Role:** DevOps & Backend Lead.

**Task:** Execute the **Full Production Update Cycle**.

**Context:**
The user is done with testing. We now want to fetch the latest live data and generate AI analysis for **ALL** valid matches/futures and **SAVE** them to the database.

**Action:**

1. Create a script named `run_production_update.py` (or use the existing main entry point if suitable).
2. **Logic:**
* **Step 1: Scrape/Fetch:** Call the service to update odds from APIs (The Odds API + Polymarket).
* **Step 2: Generate & Save:** Loop through **ALL** available matches and futures in the database.
* *Constraint:* Apply the standard filters (Skip if Probability < 1%).
* *Crucial:* Ensure the results are **saved to the database** (not just printed).


* **Step 3: Logging:** Print a progress bar or log (e.g., "Processing 1/50...", "Saved to DB").


3. **Run it:** Execute the script immediately.

**Goal:** Populate the live website with fresh, high-quality AI analysis for every single valid betting opportunity.
